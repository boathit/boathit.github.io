## Chapter 2 Operations

> An operation * on $$A$$ is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair $$(a,b)$$ of elements of $$A$$ exactly one element $$a * b$$ in $$A$$.

An operation * is **commutative** if it satisfies the equation

$$a * b = b * a$$

for any two elements $$a, b$$ in $$A$$.

It is **associative** if it satisfies the equation

$$(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$$

for any three elements $$a, b,$$ and $$c$$ in $$A$$.

If there is an element $$e$$ in $$A$$ with the property that 

$$e * a = a = a * e$$

for every element $$a$$ in $$A$$, then $$e$$ is called an **identity** or **neutral element** with respect to the operation *.

If $$A$$ is an element of $$A$$, and $$x$$ is an element of $$A$$ such that

$$a * x = e = x * a$$

then $$x$$ is called the inverse of $$a$$.
