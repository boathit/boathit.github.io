### Linux Environment

#### Preparing 

If you use Linux OS and Mac OSX, you can directly launch the terminal.

If you use Windows OS, you can install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), [check the tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview).

#### Learning Linux Command

You should familarize yourself with the most commonly used linux command lines, they are indispensable for running code remotely on the servers. [Check this tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview).

### Useful Tools

#### VSCode 

VSCode features tons of useful extensions and supports all mainstream programming languages. You can use it to write code, jupyter notebooks, markdown files, launch terminals and run commands,  and even connect to a remote server to run all aforementioned tasks.

#### Anaconda3 

Anaconda3 is an integrated scientific computing package for Python, it includes all useful packages relevant to numerical computing. [Downloading](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads) the appropriate version depending on your system.

#### Jupyter Notebook

It will get installed with Anaconda3.

#### Markdown and LaTeX

Very useful for making math notes and academic writing, learning the basics from this [tutorial](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Fg411j7CW?share_source=copy_web).

## Core Courses

### Mathematics

Keep learning the math during your entire acedemic career or maybe during your life. Use the book *Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms: A Unified Approach* to study the prerequisites.

### CS 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

This course not only teaches you programming but also helps you develop the computational thinking. All relevant resources are available at its [official website](https://cs61a.org/).

### Numpy and Visualization 

Numpy is an essential tool for manipulating matrices and vectors in Python. Use the book *Python for Data Analysis* to learn the basics as well as data visualization methods.

### Algorithms and Data Structures

### Operating System

### Machine Learning and Data Mining Techniques
