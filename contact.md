## LI Xiucheng (李修成)

I am an Assistant Professor of School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen). Prior to joining HITSZ, I was a Research Fellow at SCALE@NTU and completed my PhD study at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, advisor, [CONG Gao](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/gaocong).

I am broadly interested in many topics in numerical optimization, high-dimensional statistics, machine learning and data mining.  At present, I focus on **representation learning**, **Bayesian generative models**, and in particular, extending their applications in **spatial and time series data analysis**.
