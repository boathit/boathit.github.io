## LI Xiucheng (李修成)

I am a Research Fellow at SCALE@NTU. I obtained my PhD from School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University.

I am broadly interested in many topics in numerical optimization, high-dimensional statistics, machine learning, and data mining.  At present, I focus on **representation learning**, **differentiable generative models** (differentiable functions supported hierarchical Bayesian models, variational inference, Hamilton Monte Carlo), and in particular, extending their applications in **spatial and temporal data analytics**.
